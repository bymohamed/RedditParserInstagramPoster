Hi! This python bot will download images using reddit API then post them in Instagram.<br />
You'll have to change values in Python files in order to excute the program.<br />

`r_memes.py` : Reddit parser.<br />
`resize.py` : Resizes the pictures in order to fit in an instagram squared post.<br />

## How to excute the bot

All you need is to changes the values in launcher.py and r_memes.py to your Reddit and Instagram logins and then run this :<br />
